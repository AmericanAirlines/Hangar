### Pre-requisites:
- [ ] I looked through both [open and closed issues](../issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue) and did not find another request for the same or similar feature.

<!-- What's on your mind? Keep in mind you decided to open a "Regular Issue" instead of a bug report OR feature request -->
<!-- If you'd rather file a bug report or create a feature request, go back and select one of those options -->
