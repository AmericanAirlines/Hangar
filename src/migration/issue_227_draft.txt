Steps necessary:
    Delete all files in this folder.
    Drop database(? Not 100% sure what this entails. Does this require me to empty the postgres database or to simply delete it?)
    Re-create database (Presumably empty)
    Run the following command:
        'npm run typeorm migration:run'
        'npm run typeorm migration:generate -- -n AllMigrationsInOne'
    From my understanding, there is no need to change the actual .ts files in the /entities folder, as the databse itself is not supposed to change.

Please let me know if any of these steps seem wrong!
